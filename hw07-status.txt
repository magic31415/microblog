Please answer the following questions and submit the filled-in file 
to Bottlenose.


1. What's your name?

- Max Corwin

????????????????????????

3. What's the link to your deployed Microblog app?

- https://microblog.cs4550max.xyz

4. Did you successfully deploy? If not, what doesn't work?

6. Did you successfully implement admin users? What paths are 
admin-only? What paths are accessible to all users.

- No

7. What changes did you make to clean up your application layout and 
navigation?

- New landing page that makes log in / sign up prominent.

- The only paths you can see/use without being logged in 
  are the ones required for making new users.

- Feed instead of index, only shows messages that you or one of your 
  followers posted.

- Sign up also logs you in; log in brings you to your feed.

- Destroy account also logs you out.

- No separate page for creating messages; 
  this is part of the feed page.

8. Did you complete any catch up tasks? Which ones? Is there 
anything still not working about those features?

- Everything working except Travis fails to build.

9. Did you complete any additional tasks? Which ones? For each, 
describe how it should work and how that differs from your deployed 
functionality.

- LetsEncrypt
  All traffic forwards to HTTPS
  Cron task for renewals

- Bootstrap/CSS
  Looks cleaner

- Security
  Added logic to User and Message controllers to prevent unauthorized
  access. People without accounts can't do much (see question 7),
  users cannot edit or delete other users or other users' messages

- Follows
  Now fully working, used to be able to follow people twice.
  Feed page now only shows messages that you or one of your 
  followers posted.

A. Did you complete any bonus addtional goals for extra credit?
For each, describe how it should work and how that differs from your 
deployed functionality.

 - No (unless the stuff that was already working counts as tasks)

for grading?

- No
